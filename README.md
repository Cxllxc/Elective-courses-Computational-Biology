Artificial intelligence is an important branch of computer science and is considered one of the three cutting-edge technologies of the 21st century (genetic engineering, nanoscience, and artificial intelligence). In the past thirty years, it has experienced rapid development and has been widely applied in many disciplinary fields, achieving fruitful results. Artificial intelligence has gradually become an independent discipline, forming its own system in both theory and practice.
This course focuses on exploring the fundamental computational problems of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences in relation to molecular biology functions. We use combination algorithms and machine learning algorithms to solve these problems. The learning process of each chapter will follow a series of the most beautiful algorithms, which are rigorous, practical, concise, elegant, and easy to operate algorithms. In addition, each chapter will provide a detailed introduction to the biological problems involved, as well as the computer science and statistical achievements that algorithms for solving simulated biological problems rely on. The algorithm will be combined with its underlying data structure, including mathematical analysis of performance, and sometimes will also cover exciting stories of researchers pursuing algorithm optimization (speed). The entire course will provide learners with a solid foundation in the field.
